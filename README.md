# Task 7 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This is my submission for Task 7 of the AI & ML Internship.

## Objective
To use Support Vector Machines for binary classification using Breast Cancer dataset.

## What I Did
- Loaded the breast cancer dataset
- Used SVM with linear and RBF kernel
- Tuned hyperparameters (C, gamma)
- Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Visualized decision boundary with PCA

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Seaborn

## Dataset
Used inbuilt dataset from sklearn.datasets (Breast Cancer)
